# GIFinder
Allows you to search for GIFS on the Giphy API. Next version will allow to create a list of favorite gifs. Also used ES2015 Class system.
Everything is furnished in an simple express server, but you can get the front-end code only in the public folder.

## What's new?
In this project, managed to get GIFs from the Giphy API which you can find here : https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI

I also used ES2015 class system. You can find the ES2015 in the jsDev folder. To be usable on the browser, i used babel on Gulp.
CSS is generated with Gulp too, from the .scss files in the sass folder.

## Can i re-use some of this code?
Sure, it's for free ! :)

## What's next?
This is the first version, soon you'll be able to download the gifs, get their url by simply clicking a button.
I also plan to allow users to define favorite gifs, but this require a bit more work (session system).
